## Introductions
Welcome to the casino. Run "python roulette.py" and you can start playing roulette. Follow the prompts to enter your name, buy-in to the table, and place your bets. 

If you are unsure of where you can bet, when the prompt asks you to place a bet amount, enter 0, and then on the next prompt asking for where you want to place your bets, enter "see bets". Then continue on with the prompts.

Enjoy the game!
